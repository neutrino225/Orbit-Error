# Orbit-Error
Calculates the Orbit Error
Using computer calculation we might often find that the spacecraft doesn't come back at the initial postion 
after making a full orbit. 
This is the orbit error.
We can calculate this error by calculating the difference between the final and the inital position of the spacecraft
after an orbit
